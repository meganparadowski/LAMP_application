<p>This system is meant to replicate what a hospital database might look like. The data
is strictly test data (made up data). The SQL script to create the tables was forward
engineered on MySQL Workbench and populated with insert queries. There are tables for 
patients, doctors, emergency contacts, doctor images, doctor profiles, and room numbers and locations. 
For a fully functioning hospital database we would also need patients' medical histories, supply inventory, nurses,
security, equipment and usage, etc. This is a user-based system. This particular query
allows you to see a list of patients with their hospital room number, emergency contact, doctor, the doctor's image,
and a link to the doctor's profile. </p>
